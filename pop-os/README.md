# pop-os systembuilder

This systembuilder can (in theory) be run on any Debian system.

Before running installer.sh, go into the apps directory and remove the app folders from root & user that you do not want installed. App folders in archive can be ignored.

After running installer.sh you can run scripts in the extras directory if you want. The extra scripts are just for setting up development environments and shouldn't be needed for casual computer use.

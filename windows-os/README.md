### Enabling natural scrolling for the mouse's scrollwheel

If you want to change the scroll direction on your mouse, open a powershell terminal as administrator and run the following command:
`powershell -executionpolicy bypass -File .\enable-natural-scrolling.ps1`

Then reboot the system and your scroll wheel direction should be reversed.

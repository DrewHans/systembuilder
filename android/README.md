Before running computer.sh on your computer:
- Download or build Android Platform Tools
- Ensure adb is in your computer's $PATH
- On your phone, open "Developer options", toggle on "USB debugging", and then select OK to allow
- Connect your phone to your computer and when prompted to "Allow USB debugging?" select ALLOW.
- Run `adb devices` and verify that your device shows up in the "List of devices attached"

After running computer.sh:
- On your phone, open "Developer options", toggle off "USB debugging", then Revoke all USB debugging permissions
- Open up apps.md and start installing apps through F-Droid (more secure)
- Install all Google Play Store apps with Aurora App Store
- Install 3rd Party Apps if you feel like it
- Copy over your data backups and then import the data into each app

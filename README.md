# systembuilder
Automates installing my apps, dotfiles, and shellscripts on new Linux systems.

Before running installer.sh, go into the apps directory and delete the ones that you DO NOT want installed.

[dotfiles](https://github.com/DrewHans555/dotfiles/) stores my configuration files.

[shellscripts](https://github.com/DrewHans555/shellscripts/) stores my shell scripts.

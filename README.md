# systembuilder

Automates installing apps, dotfiles, shellscripts, and setting up configurations on new Linux systems.

Maybe one day I'll decide to switch over to Ansible... but not today.

[dotfiles](https://github.com/DrewHans555/dotfiles/) stores my configuration files.

[shellscripts](https://github.com/DrewHans555/shellscripts/) stores my shell scripts.
